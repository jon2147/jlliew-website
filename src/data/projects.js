Each piece is required to reflect the utility of the card within the context of the game, as well as contribute to the Lore of Wartide.\n\nThe initial test piece commissioned by Lachlan - 'Ancient Priest's Staff ' (pictured) - is intended to create intrigue and ambiguity surrounding the eponymous staff, its people and its history.\n\nEach piece is being composed to advantage their specified dimensions, while also providing plenty of extra bleed for confident printing. Colours are dynamically tested with grayscale & CMYK proofs to ensure optimal values, regardless of context.",

        projectDescription: <div><p>
            Although I didn't win, my submissions for the new annual Fivex Art Prize are getting a spot here. <a href="https://www.fivexartprize.com.au/gallery/" target="_blank">Winning artworks</a> were to be showcased intermittently among advertising content on LED billboards at the corner of Flinders and Elizabeth streets.</p>
            <p>The artworks [were meant to be inspire *get the actual quote if you can find it* the many Melbournians passing the massive displays]. I conceived the piece as one that might inspire viewers to i. seek out the potential of their world with a quixotic mind; and ii. to find themselves and others in that same world.</p>
            <p>I chose the figure of a swimmer / diver as I felt it would capture a sense of individual freedom, as well as one of aspirational determination. The swimmer navigates the atomic complexity of their surroundings – of which they are made up and in which they are reflected – in an endeavour tempered by an appreciation of their world.</p></div>,
